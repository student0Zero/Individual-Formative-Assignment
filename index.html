                    <p class="lead">
                        Community is the thread that brings people together. Community matters because it creates a
                        sense of purpose, builds social connections, and offers a support network
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Many different types of communities exist. Some groups have more of a structure, such as
                        religious organizations, co-op organizations, parent-teacher associations, trade organizations,
                        governments, and health care organizations. Others—like social networks, study groups, and
                        groups of close friends—are more informal. Follow the link below to see a few types of community
                        you can join.

                            <p> Mindfulness can be described as being aware of your actions and your surroundings. It's
                                about being present in the moment and taking note of what's going on around you. Being
                                mindful is about noticing the distant sound of a car, or the weight of the keys under
                                your
                                finger tips as you type. It's about being aware of what you are doing and not being
                                overly
                                reactive or overwhelmed by what's going on around you.

                                Spirituality and mindfulness have been intertwined throughout human history. Many

                                make use of mindfulness practices and have done so for thousands of years. Mindfulness
                                has
                                been associated with Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
